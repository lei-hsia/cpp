In C++, there're 5 types of Inheritance; namely,
- single inheritance
- multiple
- hierarchical
- multi-level
- hybrid

1. single: most basic
2. multiple: 一个derived类继承多个base类
	base_A-->derive & base_B-->derive : a single derived class may inherit from 2/more base classes
3. ######hierarchical: 多个derived类继承同一个base类(最多)
4.  multi-level: 链式继承: A-->B-->C...
5.  hybrid(virtual): a combination of Herarchical & Multi-level Inheritance
