This is the folder used to pricing the European vanilla call/put option. 

I separated FDM method implementation cpp file from the PDE file. 

FDM for either Black-Scholes model or Lognormal Stochastic volatility model is the same: both are still FDM. 

The only difference would be PDE cpp file. Two scenarios use different PDEs.

The pricing graph for a vanilla call is graphed via a python script.
