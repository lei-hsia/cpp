 In the CUDA programming model we speak of launching a kernel with 
 a grid of thread blocks. 
 
 The first argument in the execution configuration specifies 
 the number of thread blocks in the grid, 
 and the second specifies the number of threads in a thread block.
 
 mc_kernel<<<GRID_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE>>>(
            d_s, T, K, B, S0, sigma, mu, r, dt, d_normals, N_STEPS, N_PATHS);
        }
 
 GRID_SIZE: 大些, 表示一个grid中有多少个thread block;
 BLOCK_SIZE: 小些, 表示一个thread block有多少个threads;
